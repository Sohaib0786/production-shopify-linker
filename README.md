************
The objective of the **Shopify Linker Shopping Platform** project is to design and develop a dynamic, scalable, and user-friendly e-commerce application 
using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The platform aims to seamlessly link various Shopify stores into a single unified shopping 
experience, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase products from multiple sources in one place. The system focuses on delivering fast performance, secure 
transactions, efficient store integration, and a smooth customer journey across web and mobile interfaces.

Key goals include:
* Integrating multiple Shopify stores through APIs.
* Providing real-time product listing, inventory updates, and order management.
* Implementing a robust authentication system for both customers and store owners.
* Ensuring a responsive and attractive frontend design for a better user experience.
* Building a scalable backend architecture to handle high traffic and large datasets.
* Supporting advanced features like product search, filtering, wishlists, and cart management.
